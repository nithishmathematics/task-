# Cloud-Native E-commerce Recommendation System — Full Project Plan

Candidate: Nithish Kumar B  
Duration (assessment baseline): 7 days  
Difficulty: Intermediate  
Focus Areas: DevOps, Cloud, MLOps  
Specialization: Cloud-based AI/ML Systems

## 1. Executive Summary
Design and implement a multi-cloud, cloud-native recommendation platform spanning AWS and Azure (with optional GCP for serverless notifications). The system delivers sub-100ms personalized recommendations at 10k+ concurrent users with 99.9% availability. It emphasizes microservices, IaC, CI/CD, MLOps, observability, cost optimization (target ≈ $500/month baseline), and security/compliance.

## 2. Objectives and Success Criteria
- Availability: ≥ 99.9%
- Latency: ≤ 100 ms for recommendation API P95
- Throughput: 10k+ concurrent users
- Scalability: Auto-scale from 2 → 50 instances (HPA/KEDA/Lambda concurrency)
- Cost: ≤ $500/month baseline (can vary by region/traffic)
- Compliance: Encryption in transit/at rest, IAM/RBAC, audit logs

## 3. Scope
- Core services: User, Product, Recommendation, Event Tracking, Feature Store, Cart & Checkout, Analytics, Notification, Search, API Gateway, A/B Testing, Cost Monitoring
- Multi-cloud: AWS (EKS/ECS/Lambda/RDS/S3), Azure (AKS/Blob/Redis/Monitor) and GCP (Cloud Run) for notifications
- MLOps: MLflow/Kubeflow, automated training/retraining, model registry, A/B testing, rollbacks

## 4. Architecture Overview
- API Gateway: Kong or AWS API Gateway (JWT/OAuth2, rate limits, routing)
- Microservices: Containerized (Docker), orchestrated on EKS/AKS with Helm
- Data: RDS PostgreSQL (users, orders), MongoDB Atlas (products), Redis (features/cache), S3 + Blob (data lake)
- Messaging: Kafka (MSK) or Redis Streams (events) → ETL to S3/Blob
- ML Serving: TensorFlow Serving on AKS; model registry/versioning via MLflow
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK/EFK for logs, Azure Monitor, CloudWatch
- Security: TLS end-to-end, IAM + RBAC, secrets in Vault/Azure Key Vault/Secrets Manager, CI scanning with Trivy

## 5. Requirements Traceability (Assessment → Plan)

- MLOps (25%): Automated retraining, model versioning, A/B testing, monitoring, rollback → Sections 9, 11
- Multi-Cloud (20%): AWS + Azure deployment, data sync, DR/backup, cost optimization, performance comparison → Sections 4, 10, 12, 13
- Monitoring & Analytics (15%): Real-time serving ≤ 100ms, metrics, user tracking, scaling → Sections 8, 10, 11
- Security (10%): IAM, encryption at rest/in transit, API security, rate limiting, vulnerability scanning → Section 10
- Deliverables: Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD configs, Grafana dashboards, benchmarking report, cost analysis → Sections 6–9, 12–13

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform + Ansible)

  - security: IAM roles/policies, Key Vault/Secrets Manager, TLS certs
  - monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, EFK
- Environments: dev, staging, prod via workspaces or separate state
- State: remote backends (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB lock; Azure Storage + table locks)
- Ansible: optional OS/bootstrap tasks for self-managed nodes or EC2

Suggested repo structure:
```
infra/
  terraform/
    envs/
      dev/ main.tf variables.tf outputs.tf
      prod/ ...
    modules/
      vpc/  eks/  aks/  rds/  s3/  blob/  msk/  redis/  monitoring/
ansible/
```

## 7. Kubernetes Deployment (Helm)
- Charts per service with values for envs
- Resource requests/limits and HPAs
- Liveness/readiness probes; PodDisruptionBudgets; PodSecurityStandards
- Ingress via Kong or NGINX Ingress; mTLS inside cluster optional
- Secrets via CSI provider (AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault)
- Canary or blue/green via Helm + progressive delivery (Argo Rollouts optional)

Suggested repo structure:
```
k8s/
  base/ (common manifests)
  helm/
    user-service/
    product-service/
    recommendation-service/
    event-service/
    feature-store/
    cart-checkout/
    analytics/
    notification/
    search/
    gateway/
```

## 8. CI/CD Pipelines
- Code pipelines: GitHub Actions (build, test, scan, push images), Azure DevOps optional, Jenkins for UI or multi-stage orchestration
- Infra pipelines: Terraform fmt/validate/plan/apply with manual approvals for prod
- App deployments: Helm upgrade with environment-specific values
- Security: SAST, dependency scan, container scan (Trivy), IaC scan (tfsec)
- Rollbacks: Helm rollback; model rollback via MLflow stage pinning

Example GitHub Actions workflow (app):
```
name: service-ci-cd
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm ci && npm test
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/owner/service:${{ github.sha }}
  deploy:
    needs: build-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v4
      - run: helm upgrade --install service k8s/helm/service -f k8s/helm/service/values.dev.yaml --set image.tag=${{ github.sha }}
```

## 9. MLOps Plan

- Registry: MLflow with stages (Staging, Production)
- Serving: TensorFlow Serving on AKS; versioned models by path; warm startup
- A/B testing: Azure Function or Kong route-splitting; traffic weights (e.g., 90/10)
- Monitoring: Prediction metrics, drift detection, model latency; alerts to Slack/Teams
- Rollback: Auto demote failing model based on SLO breaches

## 10. Security and Compliance
- IAM/RBAC: least-privilege roles for services; namespace-scoped roles in K8s
- Secrets: Vault/Key Vault/Secrets Manager; never in repo
- Network: private subnets; SG/NSG rules; WAF on gateway; mTLS optional
- Data: TLS in transit; KMS/CMK encryption at rest; RDS snapshots; Blob/S3 versioning

- Benchmarks: Compare AWS vs Azure (node sizes, zones)
- Tuning: HPA thresholds, JVM/Python tuning, connection pools, Redis sizing, Kafka partitions

## 13. Cost Management
- Baseline budget: ≈ $500/month minimal footprint
- Strategies: spot instances for stateless, reserved for DB, right-size nodes, storage tiering, autoscaling bounds
- Cost Monitoring Service: Poll AWS Cost Explorer + Azure/GCP billing, expose Prom metrics, Grafana dashboard

## 14. Risk Management
- Top risks: model drift, cost overrun, noisy neighbors, secret leakage, vendor limits
- Mitigations: drift monitors + auto-rollback, quotas/alerts, isolation, secret scanning, multi-region DR
